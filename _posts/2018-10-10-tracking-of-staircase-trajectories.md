[comment]: ## Designing and evaluating a control law for tracking staircase reference trajectories

[comment]: *Supervisor: Assoc. prof. Arnfinn A. Eielsen*

Background:

This project will focus on designing control laws for accurate tracking of staircase reference trajectories. The steps in the reference signal require infinite control law bandwidth, which is impossible. However, by deconstruction of the reference signal in non-periodic and a periodic components, the absolute maximum tracking performance can be achieved by using repetitive control (RC) or iterative learning control (ILC), where the control law is synthesized optimally using measured plant dynamics.

Application:

Such references occur in several fabrication and inspection tasks (e.g. photo-lithography and probe inspection of semiconductors). 

**The exact scope, content and outcomes of the project will be agreed upon with the students considering their background and interests.**

### Expected outcomes
- Learning about the limits of performance in linear systems
- Modelling of plant dynamics
- Modelling of reference signals
- Understanding learning control
- Design of an ILC or RC control law.
