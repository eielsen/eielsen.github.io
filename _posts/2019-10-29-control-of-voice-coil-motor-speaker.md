[comment]: ## Designing and evaluating a control law for a voice coil motor and speaker membrane system

[comment]: *Supervisor: Assoc. prof. Arnfinn A. Eielsen*

This project will focus on implementing closed loop control for a voice coil motor and speaker membrane system, in order to manipulate the frequency response of the system. 

Background:

The acoustic properties of non-ideal speaker systems can be corrected for using feedback control.

Application:

Minituarised and physically constrained speaker systems.

**The exact scope, content and outcomes of the project will be agreed upon with the students considering their background and interests.**

### Expected outcomes
- Modeling of voice coil actuator and membrane
- System identification of voice coil motor and speaker membrane system
- Implementation of control law on rapid prototyping platform
- Design of a control law for voice coil motor and speaker membrane system


#### Resources
- MATLAB/Simulink
- Speaker and amplifier
- Hardware-in-the-loop platform (National Instruments PXI-crate or similar)
- Displcament sensort (laser interferemoter or capacitive probe)
